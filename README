SVN-Notify-Filter-AuthZMail

SVN::Notify::Filter::AuthZMail determines Subversion accounts to receive the
email notification, by scanning the AuthZSVNAccessFile file.  It removes the
need to maintain "--to" arguments to svnnotify in your Subversion post-commit hook.

           svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" ..etc..  \
                     --filter AuthZMail                         \
                           --authz_file /x/x/x/authz            \
                           --authz_module yyy
